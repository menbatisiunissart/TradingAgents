## TradingAgents Framework

TradingAgents is a multi-agent trading framework that mirrors the dynamics of real-world trading firms. By deploying specialized LLM-powered agents: from fundamental analysts, sentiment experts, and technical analysts, to trader, risk management team, the platform collaboratively evaluates market conditions and informs trading decisions. Moreover, these agents engage in dynamic discussions to pinpoint the optimal strategy.

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/schema.png" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
</p>

> TradingAgents framework is designed for research purposes. Trading performance may vary based on many factors, including the chosen backbone language models, model temperature, trading periods, the quality of data, and other non-deterministic factors. [It is not intended as financial, investment, or trading advice.](https://tauric.ai/disclaimer/)

Our framework decomposes complex trading tasks into specialized roles. This ensures the system achieves a robust, scalable approach to market analysis and decision-making.

### Analyst Team
- Fundamentals Analyst: Evaluates company financials and performance metrics, identifying intrinsic values and potential red flags.
- Sentiment Analyst: Analyzes social media and public sentiment using sentiment scoring algorithms to gauge short-term market mood.
- News Analyst: Monitors global news and macroeconomic indicators, interpreting the impact of events on market conditions.
- Technical Analyst: Utilizes technical indicators (like MACD and RSI) to detect trading patterns and forecast price movements.

</p>

### Researcher Team
- Comprises both bullish and bearish researchers who critically assess the insights provided by the Analyst Team. Through structured debates, they balance potential gains against inherent risks.

</p>

### Trader Agent
- Composes reports from the analysts and researchers to make informed trading decisions. It determines the timing and magnitude of trades based on comprehensive market insights.

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/trader.png" width="70%" style="display: inline-block; margin: 0 2%;">
</p>

### Risk Management and Portfolio Manager
- Continuously evaluates portfolio risk by assessing market volatility, liquidity, and other risk factors. The risk management team evaluates and adjusts trading strategies, providing assessment reports to the Portfolio Manager for final decision.
- The Portfolio Manager approves/rejects the transaction proposal. If approved, the order will be sent to the simulated exchange and executed.

## Installation and CLI

### Installation

Clone TradingAgents:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/TauricResearch/TradingAgents.git
cd TradingAgents
```

### Environment setup with `uv`

We recommend using [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) to manage Python, the
virtual environment, and project dependencies. If you have not installed `uv`
yet, follow the
[official instructions](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)
for your platform.

Create and activate the project environment:
```bash
uv python install 3.13
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Install dependencies declared in `pyproject.toml` and `requirements.txt`:
```bash
uv sync
```

### Required APIs

You will also need the FinnHub API for financial data. All of our code is implemented with the free tier.
```bash
export FINNHUB_API_KEY=$YOUR_FINNHUB_API_KEY
```

You will need the OpenAI API for all the agents.
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=$YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY
```

### CLI Usage

You can also try out the CLI directly by running:
```bash
uv run python -m cli.main
```
You will see a screen where you can select your desired tickers, date, LLMs, research depth, etc.

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/cli/cli_init.png" width="100%" style="display: inline-block; margin: 0 2%;">
</p>

An interface will appear showing results as they load, letting you track the agent's progress as it runs.

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/cli/cli_news.png" width="100%" style="display: inline-block; margin: 0 2%;">
</p>

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/cli/cli_transaction.png" width="100%" style="display: inline-block; margin: 0 2%;">
</p>

### Batch CLI Runs

For large backtests or regression suites you can programmatically drive the CLI using
`cli.batch_runner`. The helper wraps the interactive prompts and lets you iterate over a list of
tickers for a shared date range. Every ticker in the batch is evaluated for each date between the
start and end (inclusive) using the same research depth and optional runtime overrides you pass.

```python
from cli.batch_runner import run_batch

run_batch(
    tickers=["SPY", "AAPL"],
    start_date="2024-01-05",
    end_date="2024-01-07",
    research_depth=2,
    shallow_thinker="gpt-4.1-mini",
    pause_seconds=2.0,
)
```

This will sequentially execute the CLI for each ticker/date combination, resetting the internal
state between runs and waiting two seconds between jobs (helpful for rate limits).

Drop the run parameters into a YAML file under `config/`, for example `config/batch_runner.yaml`,
and execute the helper via `uv`. You can optionally include a `project` label to scope every
generated report under `results/<project>` so repeated runs stay organized:
```bash
uv run python -m cli.batch_runner config/batch_runner.yaml
```

Example `config/batch_runner.yaml`:

```yaml
project: earnings-regression
tickers:
  - SPY
  - QQQ
start_date: 2024-01-05
end_date: 2024-01-07
research_depth: 2
analysts:
  - market
  - news
llm_provider: openai
backend_url: http://localhost:8000
shallow_thinker: gpt-4.1-mini
deep_thinker: o4-mini
pause_seconds: 2.0
```

When a `project` is supplied the batch runner also saves a copy of the YAML into
`results/<project>/` so each run keeps its configuration alongside the generated reports.

### Backtesting Recorded Decisions

Replay prior TradingAgents decisions against historical price data with the Backtesting.py
integration. Configure the run via `config/backtestingpy.yaml`, which mirrors the batch runner by
using a `project` key to scope inputs and outputs under `results/<project>/`. Generated artifacts
include summary stats, per-trade logs, equity curves, and HTML charts.

```bash
uv run python -m cli.backtestingpy_runner config/backtestingpy.yaml
```

By default the runner consumes `results/<project>/decisions.csv` and writes its outputs back into the
same directory, but you can override any paths inside the YAML if needed.

## TradingAgents Package

### Implementation Details

We built TradingAgents with LangGraph to ensure flexibility and modularity. We utilize `o1-preview` and `gpt-4o` as our deep thinking and fast thinking LLMs for our experiments. However, for testing purposes, we recommend you use `o4-mini` and `gpt-4.1-mini` to save on costs as our framework makes **lots of** API calls.

### Python Usage

To use TradingAgents inside your code, you can import the `tradingagents` module and initialize a `TradingAgentsGraph()` object. The `.propagate()` function will return a decision. You can run `main.py`, here's also a quick example:

```python
from tradingagents.graph.trading_graph import TradingAgentsGraph
from tradingagents.default_config import DEFAULT_CONFIG

ta = TradingAgentsGraph(debug=True, config=DEFAULT_CONFIG.copy())

# forward propagate
_, decision = ta.propagate("NVDA", "2024-05-10")
print(decision)
```

You can also adjust the default configuration to set your own choice of LLMs, debate rounds, etc.

```python
from tradingagents.graph.trading_graph import TradingAgentsGraph
from tradingagents.default_config import DEFAULT_CONFIG

# Create a custom config
config = DEFAULT_CONFIG.copy()
config["deep_think_llm"] = "gpt-4.1-nano"  # Use a different model
config["quick_think_llm"] = "gpt-4.1-nano"  # Use a different model
config["max_debate_rounds"] = 1  # Increase debate rounds
config["online_tools"] = True # Use online tools or cached data

# Initialize with custom config
ta = TradingAgentsGraph(debug=True, config=config)

# forward propagate
_, decision = ta.propagate("NVDA", "2024-05-10")
print(decision)
```

> For `online_tools`, we recommend enabling them for experimentation, as they provide access to real-time data. The agents' offline tools rely on cached data from our **Tauric TradingDB**, a curated dataset we use for backtesting. We're currently in the process of refining this dataset, and we plan to release it soon alongside our upcoming projects. Stay tuned!

You can view the full list of configurations in `tradingagents/default_config.py`.
